  "description": "n    TBXML is a light-weight XML document parser written in Objective-Cn    designed for use on Apple iPad, iPhone & iPod Touch devices. TBXMLn    aims to provide the fastest possible XML parsing whilst utilisingn    the fewest resources. This requirement for absolute efficiency isn    achieved at the expense of XML validation and modification. It isn    not possible to modify and generate valid XML from a TBXML objectn    and no validation is performed whatsoever whilst importing andn    parsing an XML document.n  ",
